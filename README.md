# bubble-fyp

Bubble is a collaborative project management platform designed for teams, particularly ones working within a multilingual/multinational environment. The platform combines Agile Workflow tools (Ticket/Sprint Creation, Sprints, Gantt Chart, etc.) with real-time communication features to streamline team productivity and collaboration. 

Bubbleâ€™s implementation of a multilingual Workspace chat allows users who speak different languages to interact seamlessly. The overall goal of adding communication features is to improve clarity, connection, and collaboration between users. 

When doing research, I noticed that most of the solutions available on the market lacked reliable communication systems. I then conducted further research which emphasised communication as a key factor to a project's success. The translation feature was added because of the growing need for inclusive tools in global teams. 

Bubble was developed using technologies such as: 

React.js (Frontend) 

Spring Boot (Backend) 

WebSocket integration for a Workspace Chat
